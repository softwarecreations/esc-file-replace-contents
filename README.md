# esc-file-replace-contents
Replace file contents if file does not already contain the same content.

## Project goals
* No dependencies
* No nonsense
* Reliable, no radical changes will ever happen.
* Small, simple, easy to audit, yourself

If I have ideas for something different, I'll make a new package rather than make breaking changes.
